# üìö Description

The miniTimeCube (mTC) is an innovative, compact neutrino detector designed as a part of a larger scientific endeavor to study and understand neutrino interactions. This repository, available at https://github.com/ultralytics/mtc, contains all the necessary simulation and analysis code related to the mTC project.

The scientific paper associated with this project is titled **"Invited Article: miniTimeCube"** and was authored by a team of respected researchers. It presents a deep dive into the design, operation, and capabilities of the mTC. You can access the full article for a comprehensive understanding [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4942243).

# üõ† Requirements

To work with the miniTimeCube simulation and analysis code, you will need:

- **MATLAB** version 2018a or newer. MATLAB is a high-level language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. If you do not have MATLAB installed, please visit the [official MATLAB website](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

In addition, please make sure to clone the common functions repository and add it to your MATLAB path:

```matlab
% Clone the functions-matlab repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab

% Add the repository to the MATLAB path
>> addpath(genpath('/functions-matlab'))
```

Ensure that the following toolboxes are installed in your MATLAB environment:

- **Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox**: Provides functions and apps to describe, analyze, and model data using statistics and machine learning.
- **Signal Processing Toolbox**: Offers a variety of tools and algorithms for signal processing tasks.

# üèÉ Running the Code

To execute the mTC simulation and analysis code within MATLAB, simply enter the following command in your MATLAB terminal:

```matlab
% Launch the nView interface
>> nView
```

This command starts the `nView` interface, where you can interact with the simulation and analysis tools provided for the miniTimeCube.
