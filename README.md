# Description üìú

This repository, accessible at https://github.com/ultralytics/mtc, is dedicated to the simulation and analysis code pertaining to the miniTimeCube project. It includes all necessary code components to simulate the functionality of mTC and analyze the resulting data.

By delving into this repository, users can explore how the miniTimeCube operates, simulate particle interactions, and apply various analysis techniques to understand those interactions. It's a deep dive into the world of neutrino detection and offers a practical approach to learning about particle physics.

# Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with running the mTC simulations and analysis, you'll need:

- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) version 2018a or higher. MATLAB is a high-level language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming.
  
  Additionally, you must clone the repository with common MATLAB functions used in conjunction with the mTC code:

  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
  ```

  Once cloned, add the repository to your MATLAB path using:

  ```matlab
  >> addpath(genpath('/path/to/functions-matlab'))
  ```

  Please replace `/path/to/functions-matlab` with the actual path to where you have cloned the `functions-matlab` repository.

- MATLAB Toolboxes:
  - `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox` - This toolbox is essential for data analytics and algorithm development.
  - `Signal Processing Toolbox` - Required for signal processing and analysis functions.

# Running the Code üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

To execute the mTC code in MATLAB, follow these steps:

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the directory where the mTC code is stored.
3. Initiate the provided script by entering into the MATLAB command window:

   ```matlab
   >> nView
   ```

This will launch the simulation and analysis environment where you can interact with the mTC codebase.
