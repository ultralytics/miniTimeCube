## üìö Description

The miniTimeCube (mTC) is an innovative, compact neutrino detector designed as part of a larger scientific endeavor to study and understand neutrino interactions. This repository contains all the necessary simulation and analysis code related to the mTC project.

The scientific paper associated with this project, titled **"Invited Article: miniTimeCube,"** was authored by a team of respected researchers. It presents a deep dive into the design, operation, and capabilities of the mTC. You can access the full article for a comprehensive understanding via its [DOI link](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4942243). Understanding concepts like [object detection](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/) can be helpful when working with particle detection data.

## üõ† Requirements

To work with the miniTimeCube simulation and analysis code, you will need:

-   **MATLAB** version 2018a or newer. MATLAB is a high-level language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. If you do not have MATLAB installed, please visit the [official MATLAB website](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). Familiarity with [data visualization](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/data-visualization) techniques is also beneficial.

In addition, please make sure to clone the common functions repository and add it to your MATLAB path:

```bash
# Clone the functions-matlab repository using Git
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/functions-matlab
```

```matlab
% Add the repository to the MATLAB path
addpath(genpath('/path/to/functions-matlab')) % Replace /path/to/ with the actual path
```

Ensure that the following toolboxes are installed in your MATLAB environment:

-   **Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox**: Provides functions and apps to describe, analyze, and model data using statistics and [machine learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml).
-   **Signal Processing Toolbox**: Offers a variety of tools and algorithms for signal processing tasks, crucial for analyzing detector outputs.

## üèÉ Running the Code

To execute the mTC simulation and analysis code within MATLAB, simply enter the following command in your MATLAB terminal:

```matlab
% Launch the nView interface
nView
```

This command starts the `nView` interface, where you can interact with the simulation and analysis tools provided for the miniTimeCube. For insights into optimizing performance, consider exploring resources on [real-time inference](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/real-time-inference).
